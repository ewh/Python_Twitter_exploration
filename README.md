## What is this repository for? ##

This repository documents my efforts in learning how to use Python for accessing data from the social web, particularly Twitter.

## How do I use this? ##

#### Summary of set up
* The [code folder](./code/) contains the Python scripts to run.
* The [data folder](./data/) contains the .txt and .JSON files produced by the Python scripts.
* The [notebooks folder](./notebooks/) contains my Jupyter Notebooks, which are my playground as I learn and explore new Python functionality. These are not "final" products but are simply my sandbox for learning.

#### Dependencies:
This code is written using Python 3.5
* Python Libraries:
    * **tweepy** - Makes using Twitter's Streaming API easier. [Here's a link](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.4.0/index.html) to the online documentation.
    * **json** - Library to handle the coding and decoding of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. [Link](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/json.html) to documentation.
    * **pandas** - Library to enable data analysis and modeling, similar to the capabilities provided by languages like R. [Link](http://pandas.pydata.org/) to get pandas.
    * **geopy** - A geocoding toolbox that makes it easy to get the coordinates for a given location. [Link](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy) to documentation.
